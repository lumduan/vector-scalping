When invoked, this assistant will:
1. **Automatically stage all changes** with `git add -A`
2. **Generate professional commit message** following project guidelines
3. **Execute commit** with the generated message
4. **Push changes** to the remote repository
5. **Provide status confirmation** of all operations

### Git Operations Focus
The assistant focuses purely on git workflow automation:
